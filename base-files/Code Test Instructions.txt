Code Test Instructions

The purpose of this test is to see your approach to creating css and js for tabs that will morph into an accordion on mobile devices.

Rules:

You’re welcome to use jQuery, but please do not use any jQuery plugins.

Do not use a css framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation. You’re welcome to use pieces 
of it if needed, but do not include the entire library.

The layout must match the design.

Create all elements with html / css, with the exception of the + and - on the accordion.

For that you’re welcome to any approach you prefer.

This must work on a mobile device.
